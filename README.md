# Learning of High Dengue Incidence with Clustering and FP-Growth Algorithm using WHO Historical Data

*This is an accepted paper at the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Agents (ICA 2018)*

## Abstract
This paper applies FP-Growth algorithm in mining fuzzy association rules for a prediction system of dengue. The system mines its rules through input of historic predictor variables for dengue. The rules will be used to build a rule-based classifier to predict the dengue incidence for the next month for the years 2001-2006 in the Philippines. The FP-Growth Algorithm was compared to Apriori Algorithm by Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, execution time and memory usage. The results showed that FP-Growth Algorithm is significantly better in execution time, numerically better in memory and comparable in Sensitivity, Specificity PPV and NPV to Apriori Algorithm.

## Rule Mining Usage

The following default values were used in this research based on the data:

Support: 0.014 <br />
Confidence: 0.9

### Apriori Algorithm

Generate association rules
```
rules = Apriori.generate_itemsets_rules(data, support, confidence, lift)
```
Print association rules
```
Apriori.print_result(rules)
```

### FP-Growth Algorithm
Generate association rules
```
rules = FPGrowth.generate_patterns_rules(data, support, confidence)
```
Print association rules
```
FPGrowth.print_result(rules)
```
